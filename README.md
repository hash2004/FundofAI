## Projects Overview

- **Rosenblatt Perceptron (Manual Implementation)**  
  A complete manual implementation of the Rosenblatt Perceptron, illustrating the basic principles of binary classification and how to build a neural network from scratch without relying on high-level libraries.

- **CNN from Scratch**  
  An end-to-end implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built entirely from first principles. 
- **CIFAR Classifier Using CNN**  

- **Next-Word Prediction with RNNs**  
  Four different implementations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for next-word prediction tasks (only 3 work bcz of time constraints)
